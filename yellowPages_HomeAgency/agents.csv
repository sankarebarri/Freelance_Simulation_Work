About Forefront
Are you looking for the local knowledge and expertise of a traditional high street estate agent but without the extortionate and inconsistent fees? With the majority of buyers and tenants finding properties via the internet why pay the high street fees when you can have the same, if not better level of service at a fraction of the cost?
So what options are available?
Although often reasonably priced, many internet agents lack the local knowledge and personal estate agency service that you are looking for. Traditional high street agents offer a local service but often have higher or inconsistent fees with varying levels of value for money.
So what if there was another option? One that gave you the best of both worlds? Well now there is!
FOREFRONT…..No compromise required!
Here at Forefront we have developed our LOCAL Estate Agency business to perfectly blend people, knowledge and technology to provide a level of service that rivals traditional high street agents without the nasty financial sting.
Keeping our fees competitive in comparison to online only estate agents and offering outstanding value for money has been at the Forefront of our business model and continuously provides outstanding results for our Vendors, Landlords and Tenants.
Forefront offers flexibility to Landlords with a choice of services, the option you choose will depend on how hands-on you choose to be! Sellers enjoy a fixed fee which can be paid on completion with the option of reducing it significantly by paying part or all of it upfront! Plus if you conduct your own viewing then we reduce the fee further - the choice is yours - putting you in control.
Forefront offer affordable solutions that will save you money, whilst providing the security of a personal, local service unavailable through national online agents. There really is no need to compromise when you can have the best of both!
We’re confident that you won’t find a better quality of service at such competitive prices so why not get in touch with us today and book us to market your property."

Glovers Real Estate Sales & Property Management - Green Bay,"406 Titirangi Road
0604 Auckland, New Zealand",Not provided,http://www.glovers.nz/,"General information
At Glovers our philosophy and culture are based on some fundamental values and principles:
Your home is where our heart is.
We live in West Auckland too, have done for a good 30 years now. And even though we’ve successfully built ourselves a great reputation in real estate, we never set out to build an empire; right from the beginning we just wanted to do right by our neighbours – get the best price in the optimum time with the minimum fuss.
We do the right thing.
The truth of the matter is that every one of us knows the right thing to do. The hard part is doing it – even when no one is watching. Every day in every way we put our best foot forward for our clients.
A breath of fresh air in real estate.
Albert Einstein said ‘Common sense isn’t common practice’. You can say that again. The way we sell homes makes so much sense to us – and more importantly – to our clients. Hard to believe that no one else has thought of it! Rather than look over our shoulders at how the rest of the industry thinks it should be done, we look forward to getting the best results for our clients.
We are trustworthy.
Honesty is the soul of our business and, well ahead of a pay packet, trust is what we earn every day. The fact is if people like you, they’ll listen to you. But if they trust you they’ll do business with you.
We are courageous.
Game change doesn’t come from copying others or being a ‘me-too’. It comes from our uniqueness and our courage to do what we believe in.
We are positive.
Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm and positivity. It’s one of the not so secrets of our success.
We are community minded.
Okay we admit it. We practice a very healthy form of discrimination at Glovers. If you want to sell West, you have to love West… enough to want to live here! We don’t just know this neighbourhood – every one of us has ‘skin in the game’"

We have owned our Flat since 2008, which we purchased through Plaza.
Our relationship with Plaza goes back to 1982 when we purchased a nearby flat and Plaza have handled all our lettings since then.
We subsequently sold that property (Plaza handled the sale) and when we decided to purchase again, it was Plaza that I went to.
Plaza are thoroughly professional, they have a first class team.
They are excellent at finding the best quality tenants, operate a very efficient reference system and ensure everything runs smoothly.
Plaza are good at vetting tenants - we have never had any issues over rent or repair with a Plaza tenant.
At the end of the Tenancy, we have never had a problem over the return of the Deposit.
We have always used their Management Services - which I would recommend.
Good quality tenants only want a fully managed property - again this is efficiently run, they always email me with any queries, problems are resolved promptly.
I would have no hesitation in recommending Plaza - they will find you a good tenant and ensure your flat is well looked after during the tenancy.
Living abroad, you need a professional firm to handle any problems in your absence - Plaza will provide an excellent service."
